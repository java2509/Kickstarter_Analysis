# Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
 
An up-and-coming playwright Louise started a crowd funding campaign to fund her play *Fever*, she managed to meet 86% of her goal of $2885 with an average donation of $248.5 backed by 10 donors in 28 days. Louise wants to know what the outcomes of other campaigns in relation to the launch dates and funding goals are. The purpose of our analysis is to use Kickstarter data of different campaigns and provide these insights in Excel with visual representation to Louise. The Kickstarter data we are looking at contains information of 4114 campaigns that launched from 2009-2017.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The following steps were used to analyze the outcomes based on Launch Date:

1.)	A year column was created in the Kickstarter Worksheet to extract the year from the “Date Created Conversion” column using the YEAR() formula.

2.)	A pivot table was created using the Kickstarter Worksheet data, below is a screen shot of the field list:

3.)	The Parent Category was filtered to show only data for the “theater” since Louise's play *Fever* is in the same Parent Category , column labels were filtered to show data for “successful”, “failed” and “canceled” campaigns. The campaign outcomes were sorted in descending order.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
